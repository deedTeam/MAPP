## Commits

### Conventional commits

We use Conventional Commits approach for naming commit messages.

**Allowed types:**

**feat**: a commit that adds a new functionality

**fix**: a commit that fixes a bug

**docs**: a commit that improves documentation

**refactor**: a commit that improves code quality and doesn't alter the behavior

**test**: a commit that adds some tests

**ci**: a commit that changes ci/cd

**chore**: a commit that doesn't fit into anything else

#### **Best practices**

Use imperative mood - e.g. fix: adjust endpoint called by login button instead of fix: login button doesn't work
Create small, easy to review commits
Use lowercase
